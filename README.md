**Analyzing the Sectoral Shifts Driving Global Growth: What truly powers economic transformation—agriculture, manufacturing, or services?**

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how sectoral contributions (agriculture, manufacturing, and services) to GDP and GNI have evolved in developed and developing countries from 1970–2021. We leverage econometric and time series analysis to uncover trends, compare growth paths, and predict GNI based on economic indicators.

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Trend Analysis:** Examined how sectoral shares evolved globally and by country income group.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Quantified dependencies between sector contributions and GDP/GNI.
- **Regression Modeling:** Predicted GNI using key sectoral and trade indicators, employing log-linear models and statistical tests.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Developed economies have transitioned from agriculture to services as dominant sectors.
- Manufacturing has played a steady but secondary role, especially in developing nations.
- Services correlate most strongly with GNI and GDP, especially after a $10,000 per capita threshold.
- Policy implication: Promoting sectoral balance and supporting transitions can boost sustainable growth.
